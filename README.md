(Currently, mainly for myself, so not yet well organized or documented)  

Collection of R libraries and resources for text analysis (mining) and vizualization.  
With emphasis on processing multilingual texts (in UTF-8,  specifically Russian and French)  

Easy to run codes provided, including for getting texts from web and spitting them by sections for easier section-by-section analysis provided.



Includes: 
- various sentiment/emotion analysis techniques.
- compileble code from Vignettes from udpipe and quanteda-
All redone with Russian texts.
